## Findings Explanation

Findings are broken down into sections by their respective impact:
 - Critical, High, Medium, Low impact
     - These are findings that range from attacks that may cause loss of funds, impact control/ownership of the contracts, or cause any unintended consequences/actions that are outside the scope of the requirements,
 - Gas savings
     - Findings that can improve the gas efficiency of the contracts
 - Informational
     - Findings including recommendations and best practices

## High Findings

### 1. High - Finding title (Fellow name that found the finding, can put multiple fellow names here)

Describe the issue here. Examples from past audits are available at https://github.com/YAcademy/audits. Additional style guide recommendations are available at https://github.com/YAcademy-Residents/report-style-guide.

#### Proof of concept

Link to the line of code that has the problem here. It is best to use a permalink that includes the proper commit hash so the link points to the proper line number even when the file is changed in the future.

#### Impact

High. Brief summary explaining why this issue is high risk.

#### Recommendation

Provide your recommendation on how to mitigate this issue.
